# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-03-23 20:36:00 - Initial creation.

## Decision: Project Structure

**Decision**: Follow the two-repository structure outlined in the exit-strategy-plan.md with separate directories for frontend and backend.

**Rationale**: This separation allows for independent development and deployment of the frontend and backend components, which use different technologies (Flutter/Dart and Python).

**Implementation Details**: 
- `exit-strategy-app/` for the Flutter frontend
- `exit-strategy-backend/` for the Python backend

## Decision: Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive unit testing for both frontend and backend, with CI pipeline integration.

**Rationale**: Ensuring code quality, stability, and security through automated testing is a priority for the project.

**Implementation Details**:
- Flutter: Use Flutter's built-in testing framework
- Backend: Use pytest for Python testing
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

## Decision: Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Support both Docker and Vercel deployment options, with Docker as the primary recommendation.

**Rationale**: Docker provides more control and portability, while Vercel offers simplicity. Having both options gives flexibility.

**Implementation Details**:
- Docker: Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- Vercel: Configure vercel.json for serverless deployment


## Decision: Implementation Order

**Decision**: Start with the Flutter frontend implementation before the Python backend.

**Rationale**: Frontend-first approach allows for early visualization of the app's UI and user experience, which can help guide backend development.

**Implementation Details**:
- Begin with setting up the Flutter project structure and dependencies
- Implement the UI screens and navigation
- Add mock API services that will later connect to the real backend

## Decision: State Management Approach

**Decision**: Use Provider pattern for state management in the Flutter app.

**Rationale**: Provider offers a simple and efficient way to manage state in Flutter applications without the complexity of other state management solutions. It's officially recommended by the Flutter team and integrates well with the Flutter widget tree.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create service classes that extend ChangeNotifier (SubscriptionService, SettingsService)
- Use MultiProvider to provide services to the widget tree
- Access services through Provider.of<T> or Consumer widgets
- Implement proper state updates with notifyListeners()

## Decision: Backend Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Support both Docker containerization and Vercel serverless deployment for the backend.

**Rationale**: This dual approach provides flexibility for different hosting environments. Docker offers more control and is suitable for traditional hosting, while Vercel provides a simple serverless deployment option with minimal configuration.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a Flask application (app.py) for Docker deployment
- Implement serverless functions in the api/ directory for Vercel
- Share core logic between both deployment options
- Use environment variables for configuration in both approaches
