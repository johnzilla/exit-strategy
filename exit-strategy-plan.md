Here’s the comprehensive documentation for your "Exit Strategy" app, formatted in Markdown. This is designed to be dropped into a GitHub repo (or two repos, as outlined) for your junior developer to pick up and run with. I’ve included everything—the plan, architecture, strategy, and components—so they have a clear roadmap. You can split this into separate files (e.g., `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) or keep it as one `README.md`—your call!

# Exit Strategy - MVP Documentation

## Overview
**Exit Strategy** is a mobile app that helps users escape awkward social situations by triggering real "rescue" texts or calls. Users assign a Twilio-provided phone number to a VIP contact (e.g., "Mom") in their phone, and the app sends a message or call from that number when needed. The MVP includes a free tier (3 pre-set templates) and a paid tier ($10/month for custom messages and timers).

This repo (or pair of repos) provides the foundation for building the app with a Flutter frontend and a Python backend, deployable via Docker or Vercel.

---

## Project Goals
- **Problem:** No socially acceptable way to exit awkward or cringe social situations.
- **Solution:** Trigger real texts/calls from a Twilio number, disguised as a VIP contact.
- **MVP Scope:** 
  - Free tier: 3 pre-set templates, immediate trigger.
  - Paid tier: Custom messages, timer delay ($10/month).
  - Simple, playful UI and reliable backend.

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend:** Flutter mobile app (iOS/Android).
- **Backend:** Python Flask API, integrated with Twilio.
- **External Service:** Twilio for SMS and voice calls.
- **Deployment Options:** Docker (containerized) or Vercel (serverless).

```
[User] --> [Flutter App] --> [Python Backend] --> [Twilio] --> [User's Phone]
```

### Components

#### 1. Frontend (Flutter)
- **Purpose:** User interface and rescue configuration.
- **Tech Stack:** Flutter (Dart), VSCode.
- **Key Features:**
  - Home screen with "Rescue Me" button.
  - Setup screen: Pick templates (free) or customize (paid), display Twilio number.
  - Freemium logic with in-app purchases.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `http`: For API calls to backend.
  - `in_app_purchase`: For $10/month subscription.

#### 2. Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Purpose:** Handle rescue requests and integrate with Twilio.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Twilio SDK.
- **Endpoint:**
  - `POST /send-rescue`: 
    - Input: `user_id`, `message`, `to_number`, `timing` (immediate or delayed).
    - Output: Triggers Twilio SMS/call, returns `{ "status": "sent" }`.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `flask`: Web framework.
  - `twilio`: Twilio SDK.
  - `gunicorn`: WSGI server (Docker).

#### 3. Twilio Integration
- **Purpose:** Send real SMS or calls.
- **Setup:** Single Twilio number (e.g., +1-555-123-4567) for MVP.
- **User Action:** Add Twilio number to contacts as VIP (e.g., "Mom").

## Development Strategy

### Repositories
- **`exit-strategy-app`:** Flutter frontend.
- **`exit-strategy-backend`:** Python backend with Docker/Vercel configs.

### Development Phases
1. **Setup:**
   - Frontend: Initialize Flutter project, add dependencies.
   - Backend: Set up Flask, Twilio credentials.
   - Twilio: Purchase a phone number.
2. **Core Feature:**
   - Build UI with 3 templates.
   - Implement `/send-rescue` for SMS.
   - Connect app to backend.
3. **Freemium Logic:**
   - Add in-app purchase.
   - Unlock custom messages/timer for paid users.
4. **Deployment:**
   - Test locally (Docker or Vercel dev).
   - Deploy to preferred platform.
5. **Handover:**
   - Documented repos pushed to GitHub.

### Deployment Options
1. **Docker:**
   - Containerized Flask app.
   - Requires a host (e.g., AWS, VPS).
   - Pros: Consistent, portable.
   - Cons: More setup.
2. **Vercel:**
   - Serverless, Git-based deployment.
   - Pros: Fast, simple.
   - Cons: Less control.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter:** Install Flutter SDK, VSCode with Dart extension.
- **Python:** Python 3.9+, pip.
- **Twilio:** Account with a purchased phone number, API credentials (SID, Token).
- **Git:** For repo management.
- **Docker:** (Optional) For containerized deployment.
- **Vercel CLI:** (Optional) For serverless deployment.

### Frontend (`exit-strategy-app`)
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/exit-strategy-app.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `cd exit-strategy-app && flutter pub get`.
3. Configure API endpoint:
   - Edit `lib/config.dart` (create if needed):
     ```dart
     const String backendUrl = "http://localhost:8000"; // Update for production
     ```
4. Run locally: `flutter run`.

### Backend (`exit-strategy-backend`)
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/exit-strategy-backend.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `cd exit-strategy-backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set environment variables:
   - Create `.env` (or set in deployment):
     ```
     TWILIO_SID=your_sid
     TWILIO_TOKEN=your_token
     TWILIO_NUMBER=+15551234567
     ```
4. **Local Run:** `python app.py`.
5. **Docker Deployment:**
   - Build: `docker build -t exit-strategy-backend .`.
   - Run: `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env exit-strategy-backend`.
6. **Vercel Deployment:**
   - Structure: Move `app.py` to `api/send-rescue.py`.
   - Add `vercel.json` (see below).
   - Deploy: `vercel --prod`.

## Tasks for Junior Developer
1. **Frontend:**
   - Build home screen with "Rescue Me" button.
   - Add setup screen with 3 templates and Twilio number display.
   - Implement HTTP POST to `/send-rescue`.
   - Integrate in-app purchase for $10/month.
2. **Backend:**
   - Implement `/send-rescue` with Twilio SMS.
   - Add mock paid/free logic (e.g., query param).
   - Test Docker and Vercel deployments.
3. **Testing:**
   - Verify real texts arrive from Twilio number.
   - Test freemium features (templates vs. custom).
4. **Polish:**
   - Style UI: Minimalist, playful (e.g., bold buttons, fun icons).
   - Document any issues in repo.

---

## Notes
- **Twilio Calls:** MVP uses SMS only; calls (brief ring + voicemail) are a stretch goal.
- **Deployment Choice:** Start with Vercel for speed, switch to Docker if needed.
- **Repo Management:** Push to `github.com/<your-username>/exit-strategy-app` and `.../exit-strategy-backend`.

This should give your junior dev everything they need to hit the ground running. Let me know if you’d like me to refine anything further or split this into separate files before you create the repos! What’s your next step?
